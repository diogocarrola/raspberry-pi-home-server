# Google TV — Quick Steps

Short, copy-paste steps to get ad-free YouTube on Google TV.

Recommended: combine Pi-hole + SmartTubeNext.

Short flow:
1. (Optional) Run Pi-hole and add blocklists (`configs/blocklists/default.txt`).
2. On Google TV, install `Downloader` and sideload SmartTubeNext using the APK URL.
3. Set Google TV DNS to Pi-hole IP if you want DNS filtering as well.

See the root `README.md` for detailed rationale and testing steps.
